This is a class project for CS 410 Data Engineering, Winter 2021.

It provided an opportunity to use Python to extract and format data from a live website, and then to use statistics libraries to present and analyze the data in order to answer some questions. 
Some of the data changed from the the time of the original assignment, so some modifications were necessary to achieve the desired results.
